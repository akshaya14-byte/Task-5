TASK 5 Password Strength Evaluation Report


PLATFORM         : Windows 10
TOOLS USED       : passwordmeter.com
OBJECTIVE        : Create multiple passwords with varying complexity and evaluate their strength using online tools

STEPS:

1. Created five passwords with varying complexity.
2. Tested each password using PasswordMeter and other strength checkers.
3. Recorded scores and feedback from each tool.
4. Identified best practices for creating strong passwords.
5. Wrote down tips learned from the evaluation.
6. Researched common password attacks:
   -Brute Force: Attempts every possible combination.
   -Dictionary Attack: Uses known words and common passwords.
   -Credential Stuffing: Reuses leaked credentials from breaches.
7. Summarized how password complexity affects security.




Scores and Feedback from Tools

-12345@: Very Weak – predictable, short, lacks symbols.
-orange@2025: Medium – better complexity, but still short.
-0r@nge#123: Strong – good length, symbol diversity.
-ApPlE@12345: Very Strong – long, unique, high entropy

Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Use at least 12–16 characters.
Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
Avoid dictionary words, names, or predictable patterns.
Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts.
Use a password manager to generate and store secure passwords.

Password Complexity vs. Security

Simple passwords are cracked in seconds using brute force or dictionary attacks.
Medium complexity passwords offer some resistance but are still vulnerable.
Strong passwords with high entropy and randomness are significantly harder to crack.
Very strong passwords are nearly immune to automated attacks when combined with good account hygiene.
